Have you ever seen the awesome animations or visuals online and wondered how they were created? This workshop will dive into the code and math behind these pieces of artwork using p5.js. We will build multiple demos during this workshop so you will leave ready to build your own web-ready works!

## Notes

* This will be co-taught with Ali Spittel ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/aspittel), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aspittel), [site](https://alispit.tel), [bio](https://github.com/aspittel/cfps/blob/master/bio.md)). We are co-teachers at GA, so we teach together almost every day!
* We have taught a 45 minute version of this class to students just learning to code.

## Description

### Learning Objectives

* View pieces of art built with code
* Setup P5 in order to create art with code
* Understand some of the math that goes into code art
* Learn how to make that code art interactive

### What is p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org/) is a JavaScript library built by the same people as Processing to make web ready artwork easy to build for people at all levels of coding experience. It is great for people who already know how to code to be able to express themselves artistically using a medium they are already experienced with. It is also helpful for people learning to code because it makes coding fun and more visual. We will make this workshop exciting and accessible for all levels of coding ability.

Some the speakers have built with p5.js:

* [escher pasta](https://codepen.io/superbuggy/pen/OvxgNg)
* [Random Shapes](https://www.alispit.tel/#/)
  * [Code](https://github.com/aspittel/aspittel.github.io/blob/vanilla-js/script.js)
  * [Re-implemented with Emojis](https://codepen.io/aspittel/pen/RQKMgL)
* [Loops demo](https://codepen.io/aspittel/pen/mxExBE)
* [If statement demo](https://codepen.io/aspittel/pen/aYZYOQ)
